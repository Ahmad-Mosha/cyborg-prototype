# Community Module Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Like Functionality Not Working**

**Problem**: The like toggle wasn't working properly because the backend returns `{ "liked": true/false }` but the frontend was expecting the full post/comment data.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the `toggleLike` function to handle the backend response properly
- Modified the optimistic update logic to use the server response for setting the final `isLiked` state
- Added proper error handling with revert functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `/api/communityService.ts` - Added comment about backend response structure
- `/app/(main)/community/index.tsx` - Updated `handleLikePost` to handle `{ "liked": boolean }` response
- `/components/community/Post.tsx` - Updated `handleLikeComment` to handle `{ "liked": boolean }` response

### 2. **Comments Not Showing/Working**

**Problem**: Comments were not displaying or working properly due to several issues:
- Backend response structure wasn't matching frontend expectations
- `isLiked` field wasn't being initialized properly
- Reply functionality needed adjustment for backend structure

**Solution**:
- Updated `Comment` interface to match backend response structure
- Added proper initialization of `isLiked` field for comments
- Fixed comment loading and display logic
- Updated reply handling to reload comments after adding a reply

**Files Modified**:
- `/types/community.ts` - Updated `Comment` interface to match backend structure
- `/components/community/Post.tsx` - Fixed comment loading, adding, and like handling

### 3. **Missing `isLiked` State Initialization**

**Problem**: Backend doesn't always return `isLiked` field, causing undefined states.

**Solution**:
- Added default initialization of `isLiked` to `false` when loading posts
- Added default initialization of `isLiked` to `false` when loading comments
- Added default initialization for newly created posts and comments

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/(main)/community/index.tsx` - Initialize `isLiked` in `loadPosts` and `handleAddPost`
- `/components/community/Post.tsx` - Initialize `isLiked` in `loadComments` and `handleAddComment`

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Comment Interface**
```typescript
export interface Comment {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  deletedAt: string | null;
  authorId: string;
  postId: string;
  parentCommentId: string | null;
  parentComment: Comment | null;  // Added
  likesCount: number;
  isLiked?: boolean;
  isEdited: boolean;              // Added
  author: User;
  post?: Post;                    // Added
  replies?: Comment[];
}
```

### 2. **Updated Like Handling**
```typescript
// Before
await communityService.toggleLike('posts', postId);

// After
const result = await communityService.toggleLike('posts', postId);
// result = { "liked": true/false }
```

### 3. **Added State Initialization**
```typescript
// For posts
const postsWithLikeState = response.items.map(post => ({
  ...post,
  isLiked: post.isLiked ?? false,
}));

// For comments
const commentsWithLikeState = response.map((comment: CommentType) => ({
  ...comment,
  isLiked: comment.isLiked ?? false,
}));
```

### 4. **Updated Test Screen**
- Added detailed logging for like responses
- Added comment like testing
- Added better error handling and response display

## Backend Integration Status

✅ **Working Endpoints**:
- `GET /community/posts` - Fetching posts with pagination
- `POST /community/posts` - Creating posts
- `POST /community/{targetType}/{id}/toggle-like` - Like/unlike posts and comments
- `POST /community/posts/{postId}/comments` - Creating comments
- `GET /community/posts/{postId}/comments` - Fetching comments
- `DELETE /community/comments/{id}` - Deleting comments

## Testing

Use the test screen at `/components/tests/CommunityTestScreen.tsx` to verify:
1. ✅ Post creation with different types
2. ✅ Post fetching with pagination
3. ✅ Like toggling for posts (now shows response)
4. ✅ Comment creation (now shows response structure)
5. ✅ Comment fetching
6. ✅ Comment like toggling (new test added)

## Expected Backend Responses

### Like Toggle Response
```json
{
  "liked": true
}
```

### Comment Creation Response
```json
{
  "content": "test comment",
  "postId": "30ce5d6d-cf9c-40f7-a6c8-268e57d4443c",
  "authorId": "dae94fa3-c338-47fe-a319-702e7b9daafa",
  "post": { /* full post object */ },
  "author": { /* full author object */ },
  "parentComment": null,
  "parentCommentId": null,
  "id": "0e9eebd5-b830-4253-83e4-90160dad5ae9",
  "createdAt": "2025-06-19T23:41:14.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-06-19T23:41:14.000Z",
  "deletedAt": null,
  "likesCount": 0,
  "isEdited": false
}
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Creating Posts**: Use the community screen to create posts with different types
2. **Liking Posts**: Tap the heart icon on any post - it will show the correct like state
3. **Commenting**: Use the comment input at the bottom of each post
4. **Liking Comments**: Tap the "Like" text on any comment
5. **Replying**: Tap "Reply" on any comment to respond to it

## Error Handling

- All API calls have proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Optimistic updates are reverted if the API call fails
- Loading states are shown during API operations
- Network errors are caught and displayed appropriately

## Performance Optimizations

- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Proper state management to avoid multiple API calls
- Efficient comment loading and caching

The community module is now fully functional with proper like and comment functionality matching your backend API structure!
